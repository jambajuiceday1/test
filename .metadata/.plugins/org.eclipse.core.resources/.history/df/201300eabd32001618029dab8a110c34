/*Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific
 *  target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two 
numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.
Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.

For example:

Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9
Output: index1=0, index2=1
